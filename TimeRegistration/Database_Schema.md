---

## Time Entry Process Flow

### Check-In (Clock-In)
1. Employee selects location and clicks Check In
2. Record created in LSC Time Entry Registration
3. Employee No., Work Location, Work Role recorded
4. System Date/Time (Entry) captured
5. Status = Open

### Check-Out (Clock-Out)
1. Employee clicks Check Out
2. System Date/Time (Exit) recorded
3. No. Of Hours calculated
4. Entry/Leaving Status validated against schedule
5. Status changed to Closed

### Supervisor Review
1. Review entries for accuracy
2. Add supervisor comments if needed
3. Adjust times if necessary (User Date/Time fields)

### Processing
1. Time entries converted to Salary Entries
2. Status changed to Processed
3. Data exported for payroll

## Key Integration Points

### With Business Central Standard Tables
- **Employee** - Links staff management to BC employee master data via Employee No.
- **Dimension Value** - Financial dimension integration for reporting

### With LS Central Retail
- **LSC Staff** - POS staff records via Retail Staff ID
- **LSC Retail User** - User authentication and portal access via Retail User ID
- **LSC Store** - Store master data via Store No.

### Within Staff Management Module
- **LSC Work Region** - Geographical/organizational grouping
- **LSC Work Roles** - Job function definitions
- **LSC Work Shifts** - Shift patterns and schedules

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexing Strategy
- **LSC STAFF Employee**: Indexed on No., Retail Staff ID, Retail User ID, Employee No., Time Entry ID, Work Location
- **LSC Work Location**: Indexed on Code, Store No., Work Region
- **LSC Time Entry Registration**: Auto-increment Sequence provides natural clustering

### Data Volume Estimates
- **LSC STAFF Employee**: Low-Medium volume (100s to 1000s of records)
- **LSC Work Location**: Low volume (10s to 100s of records)
- **LSC Time Entry Registration**: High volume (1000s to millions of records) - transactional data
